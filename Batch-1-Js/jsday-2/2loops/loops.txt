Definition:
A loop is a programming construct used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met or is no longer true. Loops help avoid writing the same code repeatedly.

Why do we use loops?

To save time by automating repetitive tasks.
To reduce errors by avoiding repetitive manual coding.
To process data efficiently, such as iterating over arrays or objects.

How do loops work?
Loops use a condition to decide when to stop repeating.

If the condition is true, the loop continues to execute.
If the condition is false, the loop stops.

Types of Loops in JavaScript:

For Loop: Used when you know exactly how many times the code should run.
Example: Counting numbers from 1 to 5.
for(let i = 0; i<5; i++ ){
    // console.log("hi")
    console.log("i=",i)
}

console.log("loop ended")

console.log(i) testing

for(let i = 0; i<5; i++ ){
    // console.log("hi")
    console.log("i=",i)
}

console.log("loop ended")
console.log("i")

infinite loop
for(let i = 0; i>=0; i++ ){
    // console.log("hi")
    console.log("i=",i)
}
While Loop: Used when the number of repetitions is not known in advance, and it depends on a condition.

let i=1
while(i<=5){
    console.log(" i =", i)
    i++
}

Do-While Loop: Similar to the while loop but executes the code at least once, even if the condition is false.
let i = 20 
do{
    console.log("hi")
}while (i<=10);

let i = 20 
do{
    console.log(" i =", i)
}while (i<=10);

to print numbers
let i = 1 
do{
    console.log(" i =", i)
    i++
}while (i<=5);

for...of loop: For iterating over the values of an iterable (arrays, strings, etc.).

let userName = "Anand" 
for(let i of userName){
    console.log(i)
}

to check the size of strings
let userName = "Anand";
let nameSize = 0;
for (let i of userName) {
  nameSize++;

  console.log("i = ", i);
}
console.log(" Name Length = ", nameSize);

const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
for (let fruit of fruits) {
    console.log(fruit); // Outputs: apple, banana, cherry
}

For-In Loop: Used to loop through the properties of an object.
Example: Listing all the keys in an object.

const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25, job: "Developer" };
for (let key in person) {
//   console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}

let student = {
  name: "john",
  age: "20",
  isPass: true,
  bloodGroup:"O+ve"
};
// console.log(student)

for (let i in student){
    console.log("key is",i, "Value is", student[i])
}
